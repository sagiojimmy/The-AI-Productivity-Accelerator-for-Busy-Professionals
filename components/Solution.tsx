        Picture sitting down at your desk and:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
        <li>Your inbox is pre‑sorted, with AI drafting replies that sound like <em>you</em></li>
        <li>Your weekly report is 80% done, AI compiled the data and wrote the first draft</li>
        <li>Your client or stakeholder briefing is pre‑structured, clear, and on‑point</li>
        <li>Your meeting notes are summarized into action items and sent to the team</li>
        <li>Your to‑do list is prioritized <em>for you</em> based on impact and urgency</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        You’re still the decision-maker.

        You get to be the editor and strategist, not the overworked typing machine.

        What Makes This Different
      </h3>

      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        This is <strong>not</strong> a vague “AI is the future” course.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        It’s a <strong>tactical implementation system</strong> designed specifically for <em>busy professionals</em> who:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
        <li>Work in corporate, consulting, agency, or entrepreneurial environments</li>
        <li>Need to communicate, analyze, plan, and deliver every single day</li>
        <li>Don’t have time to “figure out AI” through trial and error</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        Every lesson answers one question:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote className="text-xl italic border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 mb-6">
        “How do I use AI to do this <em>exact</em> task faster and better?”
      </blockquote>

      <p className="text-lg mb-12">
        You’ll see real examples, get plug-and-play prompt templates, and learn how to adapt them to your role, your tone, and your industry.
      </p>
